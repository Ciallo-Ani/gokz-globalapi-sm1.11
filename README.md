# GlobalAPI-SMPlugin

This is a complete rewrite (v2) of [GlobalAPI plugin](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/globalrecordssmplugin/src/master/)
#### **Currently NOT in a stable state, not recommended to use.**

---

## **Version 2.0** of earlier introduced [GlobalAPI plugin](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/globalrecordssmplugin/src/master/)
**The goal of this rework**:

* Code managebility
* All API calls with all parameters available!
* Introduce a wider range of natives and forwards
* Have GlobalAPI plugin do less logic inside itself **(Let third-party plugins do these things)**
* Let user control what he wants from the API call, predefined forward parameters are no longer defined.
Instead you are given a JSON handle and a bunch of helpers to help you handle the data.
