# GlobalAPI-SMPlugin

This is a complete rewrite (v2) of [GlobalAPI plugin](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/globalrecordssmplugin/src/master/)
#### **Currently NOT in a stable state, not recommended to use.**

## **Version 2.0** of earlier introduced [GlobalAPI plugin](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/globalrecordssmplugin/src/master/)
**The goal of this rework**:

* Code managebility
* Implement retrying requests
* All API calls with all parameters available!
* Introduce a wider range of natives and forwards
* Let user control what they want from the API call instead of giving them predefined parameters
